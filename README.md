# Greetings ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Carlos, and I am a front-end developer. I also have experience with Java and Python. My primary language is JavaScript, and I work with the React framework. 

I don't have a life-changing-flabbergasting motivation (like everyone else seems to lmao) that led me to coding. I started coding on an Arduino board and took some C++ courses on SoloLearn for that. I have more knowledge about Arduino than most other technologies I know. Yeah, I simply like how things work... That's it.
